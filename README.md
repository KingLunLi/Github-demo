# Git-GitHub
- This repository, along with the **Github-Branches-Merging-Demo**, features sample files designed to demonstrate Git-GitHub techniques effectively.

## Git Fundamentals
- Mastered the core Git workflow, such as **staging files**, **commiting changes**, and **managing branches**.
- Differentiated between key Git objects, including **trees**, **blobs**, **commits**, and annotated **tags**.
- Used `git diff` to analyze changes across versions.

## Undoing and Resolving Changes
- Applied tools like `git restore`, `git revert`, and `git reset` to reverse changes effectively.
- Used `git reflog` to recovered "lost" work.
- Employed `git stash` to temporarily save and retrieve work-in-progress code.

## Merging and Collaboration
- Worked with **branches** to organize workflows and streamline development.
- **Merged branches** effectively and resolved conflicts when they arose.
- Explored collaboration techniques, including creating **pull requests** and utilizing **"fork & clone"** workflows.

## Advanced Git Techniques
- Streamlined workflows with custom **Git aliases** for common tasks.
- Used `git rebase -i` to squash commits, cleaned up histories, and rewrote logs.
- Marked significant milestones in project development using `git tag`.

#### GitHub Proficiency
- Connected and synchronized local repositories with remote repositories.
- Shared code and snippets using **GitHub Gists**.
- Hosted static websites using **GitHub Pages** to showcase projects and documentation.
